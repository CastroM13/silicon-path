<p>
  The Developer's Silicon Path to Advanced Mathematics and Ultimate Enlightenment, shortened to Silicon Path, is a programming challenge designed to elevate one's mathematical understanding through practical coding projects. Each project serves as a stepping stone, guiding developers from basic concepts to advanced theories, ultimately leading them toward mastery in mathematics and programming.
</p>
<p>
  This challenge is intended to be a framework for personal improvement and can and should be personalized to your preferences. However, I have some suggestions on how to approach the challenge in the form of (figurative, non-physical, theoretical, self-shoulder-tapping) badges of increasing difficulty:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Trial of Reflection</strong>
    <br>Complete the challenge using the language you feel most comfortable with.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wind becomes Lightning</strong>
    <br>Complete the challenge using the triforce of development: JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Strike the Ivory Tower</strong>
    <br>Complete the challenge using Rust and Go.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Navigate the Untamed Seas</strong>
    <br>Complete the challenge using the 3 C's: C#, C++, and C.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Silicon Path</strong>
    <br>Complete the challenge using: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Rust, Go, C++, C#, and C.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each badge has four tiers (I, II, III, IV) awarded for completing each greater topic, so in total, you can earn up to 20 (figurative, non-physical, theoretical, self-shoulder-tapping) badges.
